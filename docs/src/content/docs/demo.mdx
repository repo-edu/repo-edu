## What to Expect

The demo provides a fully functional simulation of the repo-edu desktop app running directly in
your browser. All backend interactions are mocked, so you can safely explore every feature without
connecting to real services.

<div class="feature-grid not-content">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>No Installation Required</h3>
    <p>Run the complete desktop app experience in your browser. No downloads, no setup.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Realistic Workflows</h3>
    <p>Import students, create assignments, and batch-create repositories using simulated data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Safe to Experiment</h3>
    <p>All operations are simulated. Nothing connects to real LMS or Git platforms.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Demo Scenarios

The simulation includes pre-configured scenarios to showcase different workflows:

- **New Course Setup** - Start from scratch: configure LMS connection, import roster, create repos
- **Mid-Semester** - Work with an existing roster: add a new assignment, manage groups
- **Bulk Operations** - See how repo-edu handles large classes with 200+ students
