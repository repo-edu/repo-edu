# Output Formats

Reference for roster export formats generated by repo-edu.

## YAML (Students File)

YAML roster export format. Compatible with RepoBee.

### Structure

```yaml
# students.yaml
- name: team-alpha
  members:
    - alice@university.edu
    - bob@university.edu
- name: team-beta
  members:
    - charlie@university.edu
- name: solo-student
  members:
    - diana@university.edu
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Team/group name (used in repo naming) |
| `members` | array | List of member identifiers |

### Member Identifier Formats

The format depends on the **Member Option** setting:

| Option | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Email Only | `email` | `alice@university.edu` |
| Email and Git ID | `email` or `gitid` | `alice` (extracted from email) |
| Git ID Only | `gitid` | `alice` |

### Solo Students

Students not in a group are output as single-member teams:

```yaml
- name: alice-doe        # Derived from student name
  members:
    - alice@university.edu
```

## CSV

Spreadsheet-compatible format for analysis or import into other tools.

### Structure

```csv
group,member,email,name
team-alpha,alice@university.edu,alice@university.edu,Alice Doe
team-alpha,bob@university.edu,bob@university.edu,Bob Smith
team-beta,charlie@university.edu,charlie@university.edu,Charlie Brown
```

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `group` | Team/group name |
| `member` | Member identifier (per member option) |
| `email` | Student email address |
| `name` | Student full name |

### Options

The output varies based on settings:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Include Group | Adds `group` column |
| Include Member | Adds `member` column |
| Include Initials | Appends initials to member ID |

## XLSX (Excel)

Excel format with the same structure as roster CSV, plus:

- Header row formatting
- Column auto-width
- Additional columns: `student_number`, `enrollment_type`, `source`, `department`, `institution`

## CSV Group Set Export

Group sets can be exported to and imported from CSV for backup, transfer, or local editing.

### Structure

```csv
group_set_id,group_id,group_name,name,email
3vQB4fC,2xYA9dE,team-alpha,Alice Doe,alice@university.edu
3vQB4fC,2xYA9dE,team-alpha,Bob Smith,bob@university.edu
3vQB4fC,7kZP2mR,team-beta,Charlie Brown,charlie@university.edu
```

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `group_set_id` | Base58-encoded UUID of the group set |
| `group_id` | Base58-encoded UUID of the group |
| `group_name` | Group name |
| `name` | Member full name |
| `email` | Member email address |

### Import Behavior

- **Member matching** — By email (case-insensitive). Members not in the roster are reported as
  missing but do not block import.
- **Group matching on reimport** — First by group ID, then falls back to group name (case-sensitive).
- **Reimport change detection** — Shows added, removed, updated, and renamed groups before
  confirming.

### UUID Encoding

UUIDs in the CSV are base58-encoded for compact transport (e.g., `3vQB4fC` instead of a full UUID).

## File Naming

Default filenames (configurable in settings):

| Format | Default Filename |
|--------|------------------|
| YAML | `students.yaml` |
| CSV (roster) | `student-info.csv` |
| XLSX (roster) | `student-info.xlsx` |
| CSV (group set) | `{group-set-name}.csv` |
