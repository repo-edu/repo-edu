# Output Formats

Reference for file formats generated by repo-edu.

## YAML (Students File)

The primary format for repository setup operations. Compatible with RepoBee.

### Structure

```yaml
# students.yaml
- name: team-alpha
  members:
    - alice@university.edu
    - bob@university.edu
- name: team-beta
